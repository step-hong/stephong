			<h2> Volleyball 🏐 </h2>
			<p>
				I started volley ball eight years ago and have been playing ever since. I'm more comfortable when i'm playing as a libero, but i can play as any other positions if needed. Volleyball has always been my favourite sport. It's a question of communication and skills and wihtout one or another, our team cannot consider winning.

			<h2> Music 🎶 </h2>
			<p>
				I played piano for almost ten years, but decided to stop and learn other instruments. I play guitar ever since. I also like singing but am very shy.. Since I can carry the guitar almost everywhere, it's easier for me to practise it.

			<h2> Cooking 🍳 </h2>
			<p>
				Cooking is one life-long hobby. Ever since i was little, i liked cooking with my parents, especially dishes from my country: Vietnam. I also love baking, which requires more patience. My favorite desserts to make are Chocolate Chiffon cake, Lemon loaf and crepes. My dream as a little kid was to open my own bakery shop and working with my family.
